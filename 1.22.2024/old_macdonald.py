"""
Write a program (remember that programs have a main() function) to print the lyrics of the song "Old MacDonald." Your program should print the lyrics for five different animals (five verses), similar to the example verse below:
"""

# Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-igh, ee-igh, oh!
# And on that farm he had a cow, ee-igh, ee-igh, oh!
# With a moo, moo here and a moo, moo there.
# Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo, moo.
# Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-igh, ee-igh, oh!

# TODO: discuss the string split function
