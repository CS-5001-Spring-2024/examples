"""
Implement a guess my number program. The computer will 
randomly generate a secret number and ask the user for 
a guess. If the user's number is the same as the secret
number a winner message will be printed. Otherwise, a 
try again message will be printed.

Phase 2:
- allow the user to keep guessing until the number is
found

Phase 3:
- keep track of the number of guesses too high and the
number of guesses too low
