Suppose you are at the grocery store to buy soda and you want to get the best deal. Write a program that reads in the price of a six-pack of soda and the price of a two-liter bottle. The program should print out the price per liter for both assuming that cans are 12 oz or 0.355 liters. For example:

Price per six-pack: 2.75
Price per two-liter: 1.74

Six-pack price per liter: 1.2910798122065728
Two-liter price per liter: 0.87
